# Jiu-Jitsu App — TODO

## How Claude Should Use This File
- Read this file at the start of every session
- Prompt user with a prioritized list of tasks to choose from, with option to work through in order
- Mark tasks `[x]` when complete and move them to `guides/DO_NOT_REVIEW/COMPLETED_TASKS.md`
- Add new tasks here as they are identified
- Never read `guides/DO_NOT_REVIEW/` files unless explicitly asked

## Keep `todo.html` in Sync
`todo.html` (project root) is a browser-openable checklist mirroring the **open** tasks in this file. It is the source of truth for nothing — `TODO.md` is — but it must be kept in agreement:
- When you mark a task `[x]` here, find its `<div class="item" data-id="…">` in `todo.html` and either remove it or note it complete (checkbox state itself is saved per-browser in `localStorage`, not in the file).
- When you add a new task here, add a matching `<div class="item">` block in `todo.html` under the right `<section>`, with a **unique** `data-id` (use the task number, e.g. `30.6`, or `guide-XX`).
- When a whole phase closes out, remove its `<section>` from `todo.html`.
- Do not change the `data-id` of an existing item — that resets its saved checkbox state.

## Constraints
- Do NOT push to git without explicit user instruction
- Do NOT run database commands without explicit user instruction
- Do not generate or guess external URLs
- Do not add features, refactors, or "improvements" beyond what was asked

**Token Conservation:**
- Use Grep to search for specific content rather than reading entire large files
- Keep responses concise — avoid over-explaining unless asked for detail
- Use `/compact` proactively mid-session before context gets large
- Keep sessions short and task-focused — start a new session per discrete task
- When delegating simple tasks (searching, file reads, small edits) to subagents, prefer the haiku model
- Do not re-read files already read in the current session unless content may have changed

## Task Workflow
- All active tasks live in `TODO.md`
- When a task is complete, move it to `guides/DO_NOT_REVIEW/COMPLETED_TASKS.md`
- For complex multi-step tasks, create a guide in `guides/` before starting
- When a guide is fully executed and no longer needed, move it to `guides/DO_NOT_REVIEW/`
- Keep TODO.md current — it is the source of truth for what needs to be done

## Documentation
- Create user/admin documentation for each completed feature in `README.md`
- After completing each feature, update the README — it will later become the in-app help menu

### [x] 12.3 — Positive feedback path: if highly rated, prompt for public review and open admin-configured review URL in new tab
### [x] 12.4 — Admin setting for public review URL

---

## PRODUCTION ISSUES — In Progress

### [x] P1 — Service worker registration failing in production
SW errors seen in order (each step was a fix attempt):
1. "The script resource is behind a redirect" — caused by middleware intercepting `/sw.js` for unauthenticated users → **Fixed:** added `sw\\.js`, `manifest\\.json`, `icons/` to middleware matcher exclusion
2. "DOMException: The operation is insecure" — sw.js not served with correct MIME type or blocked by implicit CSP → **Fixed:** added explicit `Content-Type: application/javascript`, `Service-Worker-Allowed: /`, `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers in `next.config.ts`
3. "TypeError: Failed to execute 'clone' on 'Response': Response body is already used" — `res.clone()` was called inside async `caches.open().then()`, after `res` was already consumed → **Fixed:** moved to `const clone = res.clone()` synchronously before the async call. Also excluded all `/api/*` routes from SW caching. Cache bumped to `ascend-v4`.
- **If still broken after deploy:** check browser devtools → Application → Service Workers for the actual error. Also verify `sw.js` returns `Content-Type: application/javascript` (check Network tab). If MIME type is wrong, Vercel may be ignoring `next.config.ts` headers for public/ files — fallback is to add headers in `vercel.json`.

### [x] P2 — Production auth: credentials login 401 on preview deployment URLs
Fixed: removed `NEXTAUTH_URL` from Vercel production env — NextAuth now auto-detects host, works on all deployment URLs.

### [x] P3 — `/api/auth/register` returning 500 in production
Not yet diagnosed. Error is caught and logged as `[register]` in Vercel function logs. Check Vercel logs for the actual exception. Likely a DB connection issue or missing env var.

---

## PHASE 15 — Anonymous Feedback + DM Improvements

### [x] 15.1 — Anonymous feedback toggle on feedback wizard; instructor/admin views show "Anonymous" when flagged
### [x] 15.2 — User search modal for starting new direct message conversations
### [x] 15.3 — Message request system: students DMing restricted users send a request instead; recipient approves/declines from /messages/requests
### [x] 15.4 — Toast notification in Settings when user disables student DMs (explains request flow)
### [x] 15.5 — Toast in MessageThread when message is sent as a request (pending/created states)

**Requires `prisma db push`** — adds `anonymous` to `ClassFeedback` and new `MessageRequest` model + `MessageRequestStatus` enum.

---

## OPTIONAL PHASE 13 — Media Archive

### [x] 13.1 — Photo upload via Cloudinary; video links (YouTube/Vimeo)
### [x] 13.2 — Gallery grid at /gallery with upload modal and item detail modal; tagging via user search
### [x] 13.3 — Filter gallery by tagged person
### [x] 13.4 — `forSale` flag with watermark via Cloudinary transformation; price field; purchase button placeholder for Phase 14
### [x] 13.5 — Hashtag model; #hashtag parsing on upload/edit; hashtag search via unified search bar; event album pages at /gallery/tag/[tag]
### [x] 13.6 — Opt-out of photo tagging setting; tag notifications when tagged
### [x] 13.7 — Unified search bar: # prefix for hashtag autocomplete, name for person autocomplete; filter chips; "Featuring me" shortcut
### [x] 13.8 — Slideshow mode: fullscreen overlay, keyboard nav (← → Esc), caption/hashtag/people display
### [x] 13.9 — Layout modes: grid (2/3/4 col density), masonry (CSS columns), timeline (grouped by month)

**Requires Cloudinary credentials:** `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` — add to .env.local and Vercel.

---

## OPTIONAL PHASE 14 — Gear Store

### [x] 14.1 — Product listings (admin creates): /admin/store — add/edit/delete products with name, description, price, stock, image URL, category, visibility toggle
### [x] 14.2 — Student purchase flow: /store — product grid, add to cart, cart modal, place order (pay at pickup model); students notified when ready
### [x] 14.3 — Pickup confirmation: admin marks orders Ready → Picked Up; student notified at each step; status filter on admin orders view

**Requires `prisma db push`** — adds Product, Order, OrderItem models and OrderStatus enum.

**Note:** Product images use URL input (paste any image URL). Cloudinary upload for product images can be added once Cloudinary credentials are configured.

---

## PHASE 16 — Multi-Role System + Instructor Workflow

### [x] 16.1 — Schema: `roles Role[]`, `VendorType`, `instructor_only` forum, `sessionNotes`, `ClassSubRequest`
### [x] 16.2 — Auth: session/token updated to `roles[]`, middleware updated, all role checks migrated
### [x] 16.3 — `lib/roles.ts` helper: `hasRole`, `hasAnyRole`, `isAdmin`, `isInstructor`, `isVendor`
### [x] 16.4 — Anonymous feedback: filtered from instructor view, UI note added
### [x] 16.5 — Instructor-only forum: access-gated, shown only to instructors, auto-subscribe on role assign
### [x] 16.6 — Admin role manager UI: toggle roles per user, student always required
### [x] 16.7 — `RoleManager` component on admin user detail page

### [x] R4 — DB push + data migration — DONE (Step 1: schema pushed, migration SQL run to populate roles[])
### [x] R4b — Phase 16 cleanup: remove old `role Role` field from User model + `prisma db push` — DONE

### [x] 16.8 — Instructor schedule view: upcoming sessions, registered/checked-in counts
### [x] 16.9 — Per-session notes editor with public/private toggle (visible to committed students on day view)
### [x] 16.10 — Class release/substitution flow (release session → notify instructors → claim)
### [x] 16.11 — Instructor-initiated private lessons (1–2 students; 3–4 needs schema expansion)
### [x] 16.12 — Instructor push notification UI (notify all committed students per session)
### [x] 16.13 — Vendor dashboard placeholder page + route
### [x] 16.14 — Schedule prev/next navigation (Day/Week/Month views, desktop + mobile)
### [x] 16.15 — JWT callback: re-fetch roles from DB on every refresh so role changes take effect immediately (no re-login needed)

---

## PHASE 17 — Class Group Membership & Schedule Grouping

Schema pushed: `ClassGroup` enum (`grappling | striking | kids | competition | seminar`), `blockedClassGroups ClassGroup[]` and `hiddenClassGroups ClassGroup[]` on User, `title String?` on TrainingLog.

**Type → group mapping:**
- Grappling: gi, nogi, fundamentals, nogi_fundamentals, open_mat, wrestling
- Striking: muay_thai, self_defense
- Kids: kids
- Competition: competition_prep
- Seminar: seminar

### [x] 17.1 — Admin class access UI: per-user toggles for each ClassGroup on admin user detail page; `PUT /api/admin/users/[id]/class-access`
### [x] 17.2 — User schedule preferences: "Show on schedule" section in /settings; `PUT /api/user/class-preferences`
### [x] 17.3 — Schedule enforcement: admin-blocked groups → class card grayed out + register/check-in hidden; user-hidden groups → class not shown at all
### [x] 17.4 — Check-in enforcement: self check-in, QR scan, and registration all blocked for admin-blocked groups
### [x] 17.5 — Schedule time-slot grouping headers (6am/Noon/PM/Comp weekdays; by class type weekends)
### [x] 17.6 — Group forums: `group_forum` ForumType, `classGroup` field on Forum; each group has a forum; shown on forum list + settings; blocked groups hidden; access-gated in forum detail

**One-time setup required:** POST to `/api/admin/init-group-forums` (admin only) to seed the 5 group forums into the database.

---

## PENDING USER ACTION

These items are code-complete but require manual steps to fully activate:

- **Phase 38 `prisma db push` — ✅ DONE 2026-06-06.** The additive `Gym.setupProgress Json?` field is pushed and the schema is in sync. (Earlier in the day the push was blocked by the CockroachDB cluster hitting its monthly Request Unit limit; the cluster is back online and the push succeeded.) The `/admin` setup-checklist card and `GET/PUT /api/admin/gym-setup` are now live.

- **Vercel env vars (Phase 19):** ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` added to Vercel **Production + Preview** (2026-06-01, new rotated key; also updated in `.env.local`). ⚠️ Still need to add **`EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev`** to Vercel (Production + Preview) — not yet pushed. Also: old Resend key `re_UaUtDYNk…` is still active on Resend's side — revoke it in the Resend dashboard if this was a security rotation.
- **Group forum seeding (Phase 17):** One-time setup — while logged in as admin, POST to `/api/admin/init-group-forums` (e.g. from browser devtools or a REST client) to create the 5 group forums in the database.
- **Belt forum seeding (Phase 27):** One-time setup — while logged in as site_admin, POST to `/api/site-admin/belt-forums/init` to create the 5 belt forums. Safe to run multiple times (idempotent).
- **Production email domain:** Sandbox sender only delivers to your verified Resend email. To send to any user, verify a domain at resend.com and update `EMAIL_FROM` to `noreply@yourdomain.com`.
- **Admin login after server restart:** If login fails with a stale session, clear the `next-auth.session-token` cookie in browser DevTools → Application → Cookies → `localhost:3002`, then log in fresh. This is a one-time JWT decryption error from an old cookie.

---

## ACTIVE BUGS

### [x] BUG-7 — Bracket winner dropdown doesn't save first option — FIXED
**Symptom:** In the admin bracket tab, the result dropdown appears to have the first option selected, but saving does nothing unless you pick the second option then reselect the first.
**Root cause:** `MatchCard` in `app/components/BracketView.tsx` initialized the `<select>` state to `match.result` = `'pending'`, but the select had no `pending` option (only the two competitors + draw). A controlled select whose value matches no option displays the first option while state stays `pending`; reselecting the already-shown first option fires no `onChange`, so `pending` was saved.
**Fix:** Added a disabled placeholder `<option value="pending" disabled>Select result…</option>`; Save is disabled and `save()` no-ops while result is `pending`. Forces a deliberate pick that always fires `onChange`.

### [x] BUG-6 — Dev hydration mismatch / stale nav (Events & Tournaments missing) — FIXED
**Symptom:** Hydration error where server rendered `/events` but client rendered `/lessons` in the same nav slot; Events/Tournaments nav links not visible despite being in `Header.tsx`.
**Root cause:** `public/sw.js` serves `/_next/static/` **cache-first with no revalidation**. In dev (non-content-hashed chunks) the SW handed the browser a *stale client bundle* (old Header without Events/Tournaments) against freshly server-rendered HTML → React discarded the server tree and re-rendered the old nav.
**Fix:** `app/components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` now only registers the SW in `production`; in dev it unregisters existing SWs and clears all caches.
**One-time manual cleanup for anyone who already has the bad SW:** DevTools → Application → unregister SW + Clear site data; `rm -rf .next`; restart dev; hard reload.

### [x] BUG-1 — Header hydration mismatch — FIXED
Root cause: `SessionProvider` had no initial session, causing server/client mismatch. Fix: `RootLayout` now fetches server session and passes it to `SessionProvider` via the `session` prop in `providers.tsx`. Additional fix: `suppressHydrationWarning` added to `<body>` to suppress browser-extension-injected attribute mismatches (Grammarly, password managers, etc.).

### [x] BUG-2 — Gallery grid images not displaying correctly — FIXED (user confirmed)
**Symptom:** Gallery view layout/density options may not visually work as expected; images may not fill grid cells properly.
**Root cause identified:** `h-full` inside an `aspect-ratio` container is unreliable cross-browser. Fix applied (use `absolute inset-0` for grid mode, `w-full block` for masonry) in `app/gallery/GalleryClient.tsx` — `GridItem` component.
**Status:** Code fix is in place. Needs browser testing to confirm.

### [x] BUG-3 — Gallery layout/density buttons — FIXED (user confirmed)

### [x] BUG-4 — Day view missing register button — FIXED
**Symptom:** The weekly schedule view has a register/commit button on class cards, but the day view (`/schedule/[date]`) does not. Students viewing a specific day cannot register from that view.
**Fix:** Add register/uncommit button to the day view class card, consistent with the week view. Should respect the same blocked-group enforcement.

### [x] BUG-5 — Onboarding: back button added to gym forum sub-step; Home Gym + Schedule Prefs editable from /settings
**Symptom:** The student onboarding wizard has no back button on step 1 (first step has no back), and while later steps do have a back button, students who skip the wizard entirely have no way to return and complete skipped information later (e.g., home gym, schedule preferences).
**Fix (two parts):**
1. Ensure all wizard steps after step 1 have a working back button (audit current state).
2. Add an "Complete your profile" or "Update gym / preferences" entry point on the settings page (`/settings`) that re-opens key onboarding fields: home gym picker, schedule preferences (class group visibility), and contact info. This lets students who skipped onboarding fill in info later without re-running the full wizard.

## PHASE 25 — Gym Registration & Discovery

### [x] 25.1 — Searchable gym picker component (`app/components/GymPicker.tsx`): debounced search by name/instructor/city/state/zip; dropdown with participating badge; "Add my gym" fallback
### [x] 25.2 — "Add my gym" flow: `POST /api/gyms` auto-generates slug, creates gym at `free` tier, notifies site_admin users
### [x] 25.3 — Gym self-registration page (`/gyms/register`): form with all fields, confirmation with member count, `?returnTo=onboarding` redirect flow
### [x] 25.4 — Site admin upgrade API: `PUT /api/site-admin/gyms/[id]` — updates tier/info, notifies gym admins on upgrade to participating
### [x] 25.5 — Gym profile page (`/gyms/[slug]`): public server component; name, location, head instructor, participating badge, member count, join button
### [x] 25.6 — Gym membership APIs: `PUT` join (active for free, pending for participating), `DELETE` leave, `GET /api/gyms/[id]/members`, `PUT /api/gyms/[id]/members/[userId]` approve/reject
### [x] 25.7 — Onboarding wizard: gym step inserted as step 2 (6 steps total); GymPicker + "Add my gym" redirect + "I train independently" skip; pre-selects gym if returning from /gyms/register
### [x] 25.8 — Middleware: `/gyms/*` public (except `/gyms/register`); `/api/gyms` routes public

---

## PHASE 26 — Gym Forums (General, Non-participating & Participating)

### [x] 26.1 — `gym_forum` ForumType scoped to a gymId; visible to gym members only
### [x] 26.2 — During onboarding gym selection: if gym forum exists → offer to join; if no forum → show count of existing users from that gym → offer to create forum
### [x] 26.3 — When a gym forum is created: notify all existing users affiliated with that gym
### [x] 26.4 — When a gym upgrades to participating: notify gym admin of existing forum and allow them to claim/take control (assign as moderator, rename, set rules)
### [x] 26.5 — Clear UI messaging for non-participating gym forums: "This is a community forum — not managed by your gym"

---

## PHASE 27 — Public Belt Forums

### [x] 27.1 — Belt forum model: five forums (White / Blue / Purple / Brown / Black), created by site admin, permanent public forums
### [x] 27.2 — Belt access rules: read access = any authenticated user reads any belt forum; post access = user can post in their belt level and all levels below, cannot post in forums above their belt
### [x] 27.3 — Belt verification display: self-reported belt shows "Unverified" badge on posts; gym-confirmed belt shows "Verified" indicator
### [x] 27.4 — Gym admin belt management UI: BeltVerification component on admin user detail page; verify/revoke buttons with inline confirm
### [x] 27.5 — Belt rank on profile: shows verification status; self-reported users see explanatory note during onboarding
### [x] 27.6 — Site admin can remove posts from belt forums via DELETE /api/site-admin/forums/posts/[id]

---

## PHASE 28 — Public Events Calendar

### [x] 28.1 — `PublicEvent` model: type (`open_mat | competition | seminar | other`), title, description, location, address, date, endDate, submittedBy, gymId, status, approvedBy
### [x] 28.2 — Public event submission form (`/events/new`): any authenticated user can submit; GymPicker for optional gym affiliation
### [x] 28.3 — Site admin event moderation: `/site-admin/events` review queue; approve/reject with inline rejection note; submitter notified
### [x] 28.4 — Public events calendar page (`/events`): public (no login required); filter chips by type; chronological order
### [x] 28.5 — Approved events on public calendar; submitter notified on approve/reject; my submissions at `/events/my`
### [x] 28.6 — Gym-affiliated events show gym name; link to gym profile on event detail page

---

## PHASE 29 — Site Admin Dashboard

### [x] 29.1 — Site admin home (`/site-admin`): metric cards (gyms, users, pending events, new gyms 7d); recent gyms + pending events panels
### [x] 29.2 — Gym management: `/site-admin/gyms` paginated list with search/filter; `/site-admin/gyms/[id]` edit all fields, tier, payment terms, member list, forum link; danger zone
### [x] 29.3 — Belt forum moderation: `/site-admin/forums` with forum tabs; view/delete posts; verified badge on authors
### [x] 29.4 — Event approval queue: `/site-admin/events` — approve/reject with inline rejection note; submitter notified
### [x] 29.5 — New gym review queue: `/site-admin/gyms/new-review` — free-tier gyms from last 30 days with member counts
### [ ] 29.6 — Platform payment dashboard: payment terms editable on gym detail page; transaction summaries placeholder (Phase 30)
### [x] 29.7 — Site admin role assignment: `/site-admin/admins` page; grant/revoke via PUT/DELETE `/api/site-admin/users/[id]/site-admin-role`; self-revocation blocked; sidebar link added

---

## PHASE 30 — Payment System (Stripe) ⚠️ TEST MODE FIRST
**Guide:** `guides/phase30-payment-system.md` (DONE — framework + spec reconciliation). Tasks below are derived from the guide's §1 phasing and §3 schema.

**⚠️ Build in Stripe TEST MODE end-to-end.** Test keys (`pk_test_…` / `sk_test_…`) + test cards (`4242 4242 4242 4242`) only. No live keys until the full flow is verified and the user explicitly approves (see `todo.html` → Phase 30 manual steps).

**🟡 Confirm before coding (guide §20):** fee rates (default 5% gear / 3% membership / 0% one-time) + per-gym overrides; whether **vendor selling** is in scope (30D) or deferred; membership model (gym-defined plans vs single dues); `past_due` grace policy; how site_admin marks a gym "comped".

**Spec-vs-codebase gaps the guide resolves (§0):** vendors aren't sellers in the schema (`Product` has no `vendorId`); memberships have no price/plan and `MembershipStatus` lacks paused/canceled/past_due/unpaid; gym tier is manual (not subscription-driven); NO Stripe-ref fields exist anywhere; store is pay-at-pickup (no payment state); fees have no home; no webhook infra. All require small additive schema (§3) — not a redesign.

### 30A — Foundation + one-time money to gyms
### [ ] 30.1 — Schema (§3): `Gym` Stripe fields, `Payment`, `Payout`, `StripeEvent`, `PlatformSettings` fee/mode fields; `prisma db push`
### [ ] 30.2 — `lib/stripe.ts` (client + test/live guardrail + fee helpers) + env vars (§4)
### [ ] 30.3 — Webhook route `/api/stripe/webhook` (raw body, signature verify, `StripeEvent` dedup, dispatch table §12); make public in `middleware.ts`
### [ ] 30.4 — Connect (Express) onboarding for gyms: `/api/stripe/connect` + return handler; `account.updated` flips capability flags (§7)
### [ ] 30.5 — Gear checkout via Checkout Session + destination charge + platform fee; gym vs platform-product branching; reconcile order fulfillment on webhook (§9). Replaces/augments pay-at-pickup
### [ ] 30.6 — Generic one-time student→gym payment (dues/drop-in) reusing the destination-charge primitive (§8)

### 30B — Gym → platform monthly subscription (Billing)
### [ ] 30.7 — Gym as platform Customer; subscribe to `STRIPE_PLATFORM_PRICE_ID`; `invoice.paid`/`payment_failed`/`subscription.deleted` drive `participatingStatus`; preserve site_admin comped override (§11)

### 30C — Recurring student→gym memberships (subscriptions on connected accounts — hardest)
### [ ] 30.8 — `MembershipPlan` CRUD; create Product+Price on the connected account; expand `MembershipStatus` enum
### [ ] 30.9 — Membership subscribe flow: Customer on the gym's connected account, `application_fee_percent`; webhooks drive `GymMembership` status + access gating (§10)

### 30D — Vendor sales (only if greenlit; needs `Product.vendorId`)
### [ ] 30.10 — [DECISION-GATED] Vendor Connect onboarding + vendor-product checkout; add `Product.vendorId` + seller-resolution rule

### 30E — Dashboards, refunds, disputes, payouts
### [ ] 30.11 — Refunds (admin action + `charge.refunded`), dispute recording (`charge.dispute.created`), payout tracking (`payout.paid/failed` → `Payout`) (§14)
### [ ] 30.12 — Gym revenue dashboard (`/admin/payments`) + platform revenue dashboard (`/site-admin/payments`, folds in 29.6) (§15)
### [ ] 30.13 — Gym onboarding copy: explain paid-tier unlocks (scheduling, store, tournaments, paid private lessons, money collection) vs free-tier retains (profile, gym forum + moderation, communication under banner); state student data is always preserved + fees negotiable / gym bears Stripe fees (guide §21.2). Files: `/onboarding/admin`, `/gyms/register`.

**Decisions confirmed (guide §21):** D1 participating-only collects · D2 payee bears Stripe fee + platform fee on top · D3 defaults 5%/0%/0% · D4 rates negotiable per-gym AND per-vendor from site-admin dashboard (override UI in core scope) · D5 USD/no-tax · D6 keep pay-at-pickup fallback · D7 hybrid checkout (single-payee destination charge, multi-payee separate charges + automated transfers) · D8 platform sub = gym's one-student monthly fee, negotiable, 14-day trial · D9 site_admin comped flag · D10 soft lapse per §21.1 capability matrix · D11 gym-defined membership plans · D12 7-day membership grace · D13 vendor selling deferred to 30D · D14 photo-print sales deferred (30D) · D15 payee refunds own sales ≤30d + site_admin always, fee pro-rata · D16 Stripe default auto payouts · D17 cards + wallets. **All 17 set.** Only gate to start coding: manual Stripe test-credential setup (30.0a–g) + your go-ahead.

**⚠️ Product note (guide §21.1):** AscendIt is a social network first; gym membership is optional. Free/lapsed gyms lose money-collection + **scheduling** + store + tournaments + paid lessons, but keep profile, gym-forum moderation, and communication under their banner. **Students always keep their own data.** Gating scheduling behind the paid tier is a product change to land with 30B (currently scheduling is universal).

---

## PHASE 31 — Gallery & Store: Gym Scoping + Privacy Expansion

### [x] 31.1 — Gallery visibility filter: all queries use compound OR (public | gym_only | private | custom); tag album page also scoped
### [x] 31.2 — MediaVisibility enum + `visibility` field on MediaItem; MediaAccess model for custom per-user grants
### [x] 31.3 — Upload modal: privacy selector (Everyone / My Gym Only / Only Me); visibility sent with upload
### [x] 31.4 — Store scoped: GET products returns platform-wide + user's gym products; POST enforces gym ownership; PUT validates edit rights
### [x] 31.5 — Admin store: platform products labeled "(Platform Product)"; gym-scoped filtering active

---

## PHASE 32 — In-App Tournament / Scrimmage System (Future)
**⚠️ Complex feature — requires a guide before building.**
**Guide needed:** `guides/phase32-tournament-system.md`

For participating gyms to host scrimmage-style in-house tournaments run through the app.

### [x] 32.1 — Tournament model: name, date, gymId, format, status; participating-gym-only creation
### [x] 32.2 — Division model: beltMin/beltMax, weightClass, ageGroup; linked to tournament
### [x] 32.3 — Registration: students register with belt validation; gym admin confirms; withdraw while open
### [x] 32.4 — Bracket generation: `lib/bracket.ts` pure functions; single_elim + round_robin; double_elim stubbed
### [x] 32.5 — Match result entry: inline result picker in admin bracket view; single_elim propagates winners; auto-completes tournament
### [x] 32.6 — Tournament results page `/tournaments/[id]/results`: public or gym-member visibility; BracketView with participant names
### [x] 32.7 — Tournament history on student profile: competitions entered, placements
### [x] 32.8 — Surface tournaments on public events calendar — public, non-draft, upcoming tournaments merged into `/events` (purple "Tournament" chip + filter), linked to `/tournaments/[id]/results`; `/tournaments/` subpaths made public-readable in middleware (results page self-gates on `isPublic`)

---

## PHASE 33 — Platform Feature Toggles (Site Admin)

Global on/off switches so the site admin can stage/launch features without a deploy. Settings stored in a single-row `PlatformSettings` table (`id = "singleton"`); `lib/platformSettings.ts` reads with safe `DEFAULTS` fallback. Site admins and gym admins bypass all toggles.

Schema pushed: `PlatformSettings` model (7 boolean flags + `updatedAt`).

### [x] 33.1 — `PlatformSettings` model + `lib/platformSettings.ts` (`getPlatformSettings`, `upsertPlatformSettings`)
### [x] 33.2 — Site admin UI: `/site-admin/settings` (Feature Toggles); per-toggle save via `PUT /api/site-admin/platform-settings`; sidebar nav link
### [x] 33.3 — Public read route `GET /api/platform-settings` (for future server-component UI gating)
### [x] 33.4 — Enforcement wired into all 7 gated actions (site_admin/admin bypass):
  - `scheduleReadOnly` → check-in (`/api/checkin`) + class commit (`/api/commitments`)
  - `allowGymForumCreation` → `POST /api/gyms/[id]/forum`
  - `allowEventSubmission` → `POST /api/events`
  - `allowTournamentRegistration` → tournament division register
  - `allowBeltForumPosting` → belt-forum branch of `POST /api/forums/[id]/posts`
  - `galleryUploadEnabled` → `POST /api/media`
  - `storeEnabled` → `POST /api/store/orders`

---

## PHASE 34 — Auth UX: Self-Service Password Reset + Show/Hide Password

### [x] 34.1 — Self-service forgot-password flow: public `/forgot-password` page → `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` (case-insensitive email lookup, always returns ok to prevent email enumeration, reuses `PasswordResetToken` 1h tokens) → existing `/reset-password?token=` page. Email copy now branches on `selfService` flag.
### [x] 34.2 — "Forgot?" link added next to the password label on `/login`
### [x] 34.3 — Reusable `PasswordInput` component (`app/components/PasswordInput.tsx`) with eye show/hide toggle; wired into login, register, and reset-password (both fields)
### [x] 34.4 — Middleware: `/forgot-password` + `/api/auth/forgot-password` made public

### [x] 34.5 — `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking: true` on Google provider — a Google sign-in now links to an existing same-email account (created via credentials) instead of failing with `OAuthAccountNotLinked`. Safe because Google verifies email ownership.

**Note:** OAuth-only users (signed up with Google, no password) can use the forgot-password flow to *set* a password, which then enables credentials login. With 34.5, email→Google also works seamlessly now.

---

## PHASE 35 — First-Impression UX Audit (Guide) — DONE

### [x] 35.1 — Create `guides/phase35-ux-audit.md` — DONE (per-role walkthrough; flags DUP/BLOAT/CLUTTER/CONT; ordered fix list → Phase 36)
### [x] 35.2 — Triage the fix list into actionable tasks — DONE (Phase 36 below)

---

## PHASE 36 — UX Audit Fixes (execution of `guides/phase35-ux-audit.md`)

Ordered by first-impression impact. See the guide's §9 for full context. Do each as its own commit. `OnboardingWizard.tsx` is touched by 36.1/36.3/36.4/36.7/36.9 — do 36.1 first, then batch the smaller copy/field edits.

### [x] 36.1 — Fix onboarding gym return-from-register (HIGH — the named redundancy) — DONE
When returning from "Add my gym" (`initialGymId`/`initialGymName` present), the wizard now starts at **step 2's gym-forum sub-step** instead of restarting at step 1 + re-prompting for the gym. Shows a "You created {gym} — you're now a member" confirmation banner. Step-1 data is preserved (persisted on Next, re-passed via props). **Finding:** `POST /api/gyms` already auto-joins the creator as `active` and sets `gymId`, so no membership PUT is needed on the return path; the PUT (still used on the normal pick-existing-gym path) is idempotent (`upsert`/`update:{}`), so Back→Next is safe. File: `app/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx`. Typecheck clean; full register→return loop not browser-tested.

### [x] 36.2 — Brand name resolved (not a rename) — DONE
User clarified: **AscendIt** is the app name (already consistent in the UI — Header, layout title, onboarding, gym-register all say AscendIt). **Ascend** is intentionally repurposed as a demo gym (see Phase 37). No UI rename needed.

### [x] 36.3 — Remove Avatar URL from onboarding step 1 — DONE (removed field + state; avatar editing stays in `/profile/edit`)

### [x] 36.4 — Standardize skip / secondary-button copy — DONE (steps 3/4/5 now all "Skip for now"; step 2's "I train independently" kept — distinct path choice, not a skip)

### [x] 36.5 — Resolve dead-end placeholders — DONE (admin-tour CTAs now link to `/gyms/register` instead of a guessed `mailto`; "wired later" disclaimer removed. `/vendor` stub already labeled "Coming soon" — left as-is)

### [x] 36.6 — Audit first-run empty states — DONE
Audited dashboard, journal, gallery, forum, schedule: empty states already inviting (CTAs/links present; schedule per-day "—" is an appropriate column placeholder). Also fixed a Phase 37 continuity gap found during the audit: dashboard now hides the **Training Journal** section and **Private Lessons** card when those features are off for the gym (was showing dead links that bounced to /dashboard). File: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`.

### [ ] 36.7 — Lighten the onboarding reflection step (LOW) — ⏸️ NEEDS YOUR CALL
Three open-ended prompts at first run is heavy. Collapse to one optional prompt; full reflection stays at `/reflection/edit`. File: `OnboardingWizard.tsx`. **Parked (not auto-done):** this removes data we currently collect at signup (why-started / challenges / goals feed the journal/profile). Confirm you want to trim it, and which single prompt to keep, before I cut the other two.

### [x] 36.8 — Group/section the admin user-detail screen — DONE (split the flat stack into two labeled groups with divider headers: "Admin Controls" = role/class-access/email/belt; "Profile & History" = contact/rank/attendance/notes)

### [x] 36.9 — Fix "Step 2 of 6" double-label on the gym-forum sub-step — DONE (sub-step now reads "Step 2 · Gym Forum")

### [x] 36.10 — Verify privileged-area nav consistency — DONE (verified deliberate; documented in `guides/phase35-ux-audit.md` CONT-7: global header for all; card hubs for shallow admin/instructor areas; sidebar for the deeper site-admin console — keep them distinct)

**Out of scope (tracked separately as feature-audit gaps, not UX bloat):** hidden-group forum notification muting, custom media-access edit UI, `allowMediaTagging` pre-submit check, per-type in-app notification preference threading.

---

## PHASE 37 — Per-Gym Feature Toggles + UI Hiding — DONE

Guide: `guides/phase37-gym-feature-toggles.md`. Gym admins can turn optional features on/off for their own gym, mirroring the Phase 33 platform toggles. A feature is on only if platform AND gym allow it; `admin`/`site_admin` bypass. Toggles now also **hide** features in the UI (nav + page), not just block the API.

Schema pushed: new `GymFeatures` model (`gymId @unique`, 6 booleans, cascade). Kept separate from `GymSettings` so the global `reviewUrl`/feedback flow is untouched.

### [x] 37.1 — `GymFeatures` model + `lib/gymFeatures.ts` (`getGymFeatures`, `upsertGymFeatures`, labels) + `prisma db push`
### [x] 37.2 — `lib/features.ts` `getEffectiveFeatures(session)` = platform AND gym, admin/site_admin bypass
### [x] 37.3 — UI hide: `layout.tsx` computes features → `Header` hides Tournaments/Lessons/Journal/Gallery/Store nav (desktop + mobile); server guards on the 5 feature pages redirect to `/dashboard` when off
### [x] 37.4 — API enforcement via `getEffectiveFeatures`: store orders, tournament register, media upload, gym forum (now also honors gym flag), + new checks on private lessons & training-logs
### [x] 37.5 — Gym-admin UI: "Gym Features" section on `/admin/settings` (`GymFeaturesForm`) backed by `GET/PUT /api/admin/gym-features` (scoped to the admin's gym)
### [x] 37.6 — Confirmed Phase 33 site-admin toggles were API-only (no UI hiding); UI hiding now added for both platform + gym scopes via the shared effective-features path
### [x] 37.7 — Demo gym: `scripts/setup-ascend-gym.ts` created "Ascend" (participating); moved 3 instructors (Admin User, Marcus Silva, Dana Lee) into it. **Note:** existing classes/forums remain under "Ascend BJJ Test Gym" — only instructor membership moved.
### [x] 37.8 — Follow-up UI gaps closed: server guards added to `/journal/new` and `/lessons/new`; "+ Submit Event" button on `/events` now hidden when event submission is off (platform `allowEventSubmission`, admin bypass).

**Verified** — typecheck clean; schema pushed; `scripts/verify-gym-features.ts` exercises real `getEffectiveFeatures` (10/10: gym-flag hide, platform-flag hide, admin + site_admin bypass, no-gym defaults); dev server compiles touched routes (`/events` 200, gated routes 307, no compile errors). Not click-through tested — no headless browser available in this env.

⚠️ **Finding — platform toggles already OFF in DB:** the `PlatformSettings` singleton currently has `storeEnabled=false`, `galleryUploadEnabled=false`, `allowEventSubmission=false`, `allowBeltForumPosting=false` (staged off, likely Phase 33). With the new UI-hiding, non-admin users now **don't see Store/Gallery nav or the Submit Event button** and are redirected off `/store` and `/gallery` (admins bypass). Before this change those were visible but action-blocked. Flip them on at `/site-admin/settings` (or via `upsertPlatformSettings`) if they should be live.

---

## PHASE 38 — Registration & Onboarding Separation (Owner vs Individual) — DONE
All tasks complete — moved to `guides/DO_NOT_REVIEW/COMPLETED_TASKS.md`. Owner intent branch, admin+instructor grant wiring (`asOwner`), `/onboarding/owner` wizard, member preview, dup detection, and the `/admin` setup checklist (`Gym.setupProgress`) are built and typecheck/build-clean.
`Gym.setupProgress Json?` was pushed (✅ 2026-06-06) — schema in sync, checklist card/API live.

### [x] 38.1 — Branch registration intent: landing + `/register` offer "Join as an athlete" vs "Register or claim a gym" (carry `?intent=owner`). Athletes → student onboarding; owners → `/onboarding/owner`.
### [x] 38.2 — Owner onboarding flow (`/onboarding/owner`): gym-only, full-feature, no money/tier talk. Owner-context `POST /api/gyms` (`asOwner:true`) instantly grants `admin` + `instructor`, sets `gymId`. Finish marks both onboarded + `onboardingDone=true`.
### [x] 38.3 — In-app guided setup checklist; tracks completion via `Gym.setupProgress Json?`; "Finish setting up" card on `/admin`.
### [x] 38.4 — During owner onboarding, show users already associated with the gym (count + roster preview).
### [x] 38.5 — Duplicate / similar-gym detection + warn-and-fork (name+state loose / name+zip tight); claim mechanics → Phase 39.

---

## PHASE 39 — Gym Claiming & Forum Adoption
Extends Phase 26.4 (which only allows claiming on upgrade-to-participating).

### [ ] 39.1 — Owner-initiated claim: searchable list of unclaimed gyms / community gym forums; an owner can claim one if their student created it OR it matches their name/address/phone/website. Requires a verification step before transfer of control.
### [ ] 39.2 — On successful claim: assign owner as gym admin/moderator, allow rename + rules, notify existing affiliated members (reuse 26.3/26.4 notification path).

---

## PHASE 40 — Invitations (Individual + Bulk CSV)
No invite system exists today.

### [ ] 40.1 — Individual invite: shareable invite **link**, **QR code**, and **email** invite so any user can invite friends. Invite carries optional gym context.
### [ ] 40.2 — Bulk invite via **CSV** with **flexible/editable column mapping**: user uploads whatever CSV they have and maps their columns to app fields (no reformatting). Suggested mappable fields: name, email, phone, membership type, monthly fee, belt, age, notes, instructor (yes/no boolean), start date, emergency contact. Unmapped columns ignored; preview before import.
### [ ] 40.3 — Invite acceptance flow: brand-new users register **pre-associated** to the inviting gym; **already-registered** users are prompted to associate with (or switch to) the gym rather than duplicating. Ties into 38.5 dup handling.
### [ ] 40.4 — Instructor-flagged rows: when a CSV row is marked instructor=yes, **confirm with the owner** before granting elevated (instructor) permissions to teach assigned classes / private lessons.
### [ ] 40.5 — Gym-account-specific invites: bulk invites sent during owner onboarding are scoped/branded to that gym account.

---

## PHASE 41 — Class Grouping & Group Forums at Creation
Phase 17 gives 5 fixed `ClassGroup` enum forums; this adds **owner-defined** grouping when building the schedule.

### [ ] 41.1 — When entering/editing classes on the schedule, allow grouping classes into a named group and optionally **auto-create a forum** for that group. (Decide: extend `ClassGroup` enum vs. a free-form `ClassGroup`/`ClassSeries` model.)

---

## PHASE 42 — Private Lesson Availability & Provider Approval
Today `/lessons/new` is just an instructor dropdown + free `datetime-local` (no availability, no slots).

### [ ] 42.1 — Instructor availability: instructors enter recurring/one-off availability windows for private instruction.
### [ ] 42.2 — Request UX: selecting an instructor shows that instructor's **available slots**; reuse the schedule calendar to show days where instructors are available.
### [ ] 42.3 — "Only show instructors from my home gym" toggle (**default on**); turning it off surfaces instructors from other gyms.
### [ ] 42.4 — Individual (non-gym) private-lesson providers must be **approved by a verified black belt** on the platform before they can offer lessons.

---

## PHASE 43 — Legal: Waivers, Terms & Agreements ⚠️ NEEDS ATTORNEY
**⚠️ I can scaffold storage / upload / acceptance tracking, but cannot draft legally valid waiver, hold-harmless, or ToS text. The actual legal language (Virginia-valid) must come from a licensed attorney.** Tasks below are the app plumbing only.

### [ ] 43.1 — Platform legal docs surface: Terms of Service + agreement acceptance for app↔gym-owner, app↔vendor, app↔general-user (versioned, timestamped acceptance).
### [ ] 43.2 — Gym-uploaded liability waivers: gym owners upload their own waiver (PDF/text); students must accept it when joining that gym. Store version + acceptance record per student.
### [ ] 43.3 — Acceptance audit trail: who accepted which document version, when, and from where; surfaced to gym admin + site admin.

---

## PHASE 44 — Realtime UX: Messaging, Push, Forums, Dashboard, Onboarding — DONE
Browser-verified (Playwright, desktop + mobile). Schema change pushed. Not committed.

### [x] 44.1 — Messaging without refresh: `MessageThread` polls `GET /api/messages/[userId]` every 5s, merges new messages by last-id, marks-read + clears unread badge on incoming. No socket/rebuild.
### [x] 44.2 — Push centralized: `sendPush` now fires inside `createNotification` (inherits per-type pref gating via dynamic import) so **every** notification type pushes — incl. DMs, which previously never did. Removed 5 redundant explicit `sendPush` calls. Verified all 3 VAPID vars present in Vercel Prod + Preview.
### [x] 44.3 — Cron removed: deleted dormant `app/api/cron/*` (nothing scheduled them — `vercel.json` was `{}`); removed unused `CRON_SECRET` from `.env.local` + Vercel Prod. App has zero cron dependency (reminders/feedback fire inline on commit/check-in).
### [x] 44.4 — Forum list cleanup: unsubscribed forums hidden by default (gym/own-belt/announcements always shown); "Show all available forums (N)" reveal button; sections sort unread-first then latest activity. Nav label "Forum" → "Forums".
### [x] 44.5 — Forum unread badges: new `ForumRead` model (`prisma db push` done) — opening a forum stamps read time; red count badge (9+ cap) + bold + left-accent on forums with new posts since last view (excludes own posts; quiet until first visit).
### [x] 44.6 — Dashboard restructure: grouped zones (This Week → Community → You → Manage) with icon tiles + color-coded left accents; Messages tile w/ unread badge; attendance demoted off top + hidden when empty; gym-aware empty state (no-gym → Events CTA).
### [x] 44.7 — Onboarding finish: animated `☰` menu cue on step 6; gym-aware primary CTA (gym → Schedule "Register for class"; no-gym → Events "find local open mats…").

### [x] 44.8 — PWA app icons regenerated from `logo.png` (pyramid) via `scripts/generate-pwa-icons.mjs` — replaces stale blue-"A" icons. **User action:** installed phones cache the old icon; reinstall to pick up. Per-gym custom *installed* icons not feasible without subdomains (documented).

---

## PHASE 45 — User Follow + Activity Feed
Guide: `guides/phase45-user-follow.md`. **One-way** follow (no approval) + activity feed + post notifications. Schema pushed. Browser-verified (follow 0→1, persists, feed renders). Not committed.

### [x] 45.1 — `Follow` model (`followerId`/`followingId`, unique, indexed) + User relations + `new_follower`/`followed_post` NotificationType values; `prisma db push`
### [x] 45.2 — `lib/feed.ts` `PUBLIC_FORUM_TYPES` (general/announcement/belt_forum/group_forum) — gates feed/notifications/profile-posts so restricted content never leaks
### [x] 45.3 — Follow API `POST/DELETE /api/users/[id]/follow` (idempotent, blocks self-follow, `new_follower` notify which now also pushes)
### [x] 45.4 — `FollowButton` (optimistic follow/unfollow) on public profile
### [x] 45.5 — Public profile: gym affiliation under name (links to `/gyms/[slug]`); follower/following counts; FollowButton; post history + "Show all activity I can see" viewer toggle (adds same-gym forum posts)
### [x] 45.6 — Activity feed `/feed` (top-level posts from people you follow, public forums only) + Feed nav link (desktop + mobile)
### [x] 45.7 — Follower-post notification in `POST /api/forums/[id]/posts` (public forums only; dedupes against forum subscribers)
### [ ] 45.8 — "Show on public profile" checkboxes for phone + email (onboarding contact step + profile-edit) + render contact on public profile when set public. **Pending your call** (confirm whether email should ever be shown).

## PHASE 46 — Gym Custom Student Onboarding (Participating/Paid Gyms)
Participating (paid) gyms can customize the new-student onboarding for members joining their gym, beyond the default minimal flow. Free/individual onboarding stays minimal (default flow no longer asks for emergency contact — that's now a gym-requestable field).

### [ ] 46.1 — Gym-admin onboarding builder: participating gyms define which fields/steps to request from new students (e.g. emergency contact, waiver acceptance [Phase 43], membership type, medical notes, custom questions). Free gyms get the default flow only.
### [ ] 46.2 — Emergency contact as an opt-in gym field: gyms can toggle "request emergency contact" on; when on, it's added to that gym's student onboarding (and editable in profile). Default/individual onboarding does NOT ask.
### [ ] 46.3 — Onboarding flow resolution: when a student joins/affiliates with a participating gym (incl. via invite — Phase 40), run that gym's custom onboarding; otherwise the default. Store gym-custom answers per membership.
### [ ] 46.4 — Gating: custom onboarding is a paid-tier capability (ties to Phase 30 tier model + Phase 37 feature toggles).
### [ ] 46.5 — QR check-in as a gym-onboarding option: QR display is now auto-gated to participating-gym members (hidden otherwise). Make enabling/branding the per-user QR check-in an explicit toggle in the participating-gym onboarding/setup.

**Note:** emergency-contact field was removed from the default onboarding (2026-06-02). The `User.emergencyContact` column is retained for gyms that request it via 46.2.

## GUIDES NEEDED (before building the above phases)

- [ ] `guides/phase24-multi-gym-architecture.md` — schema redesign, model changes, migration plan
- [x] `guides/phase38-owner-onboarding.md` — DONE (owner-vs-individual registration split, admin-grant wiring, owner setup flow, dup detection)
- [x] `guides/phase30-payment-system.md` — DONE (Stripe Connect/Billing framework, spec-vs-schema reconciliation, phased task list)
- [ ] `guides/phase32-tournament-system.md` — bracket formats, scoring, real-time updates
- [x] `guides/phase35-ux-audit.md` — DONE (per-role UI walkthrough; ordered fix list → Phase 36)

---

## PHASE 47 — Beta Launch Prep (before real testers)
Soft-release data cleanup is DONE (see 2026-06-02 log). Code pushed to `origin/main` 2026-06-02. Remaining before inviting the 6am crew:

### [ ] 47.1 — Email delivery (BLOCKING): Resend is sandbox-only (delivers only to the verified address) and `EMAIL_FROM` was never pushed to Vercel. Verify a domain in Resend + set `EMAIL_FROM=noreply@<domain>` in Vercel (Prod+Preview). Without this, password reset / email confirm / future invites don't reach real users.
### [ ] 47.2 — Legal: minimal Privacy Policy + Terms of Service pages + links on register/footer (real people signing up & posting). Full version = Phase 43.
### [ ] 47.3 — Abuse/rate limiting on public endpoints (register, forgot-password, forum posting) — Vercel BotID/WAF or simple limiter.
### [ ] 47.4 — Error monitoring (Sentry or Vercel observability) to catch crashes during beta.
### [ ] 47.5 — Onboarding path for the crew: no invite system yet (Phase 40). They self-register + pick "Ascend Jiu Jitsu" in the gym picker. Provide a shareable signup link + verify the picker finds the gym.
### [ ] 47.6 — Seed a welcome/announcement post in General + 6am Crew so forums aren't empty on day one.
### [x] 47.7 — Hide dev "Delete account" button in production (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'` gate on dashboard). NOTE: `DELETE /api/account` route still live (self-only); optionally gate it too.
### [x] 47.8 — Forum media (photos) — DONE via **Phase 49** (per-forum galleries). Photos upload + inline + per-forum gallery; video file upload still deferred (links only).

---

## PHASE 48 — "'ScendIt" Button Branding
### [x] 48.1 — Group A renamed to `'ScendIt`: forum new-post, forum reply-submit (the `↩ Reply` toggle stays "Reply"), DM send, lesson-message send. Journal save (new+edit) also renamed (first Group B item). Loading/pending states kept (Posting…/Saving…/Pending).
### [ ] 48.2 — Group B (remaining) — DECISION NEEDED: whether to also rename Events submit, lesson request, profile/settings save, gallery upload, gym register, admin create-forms. Group C (auth/destructive: Sign In, Create Account, password reset, Place Order, Check In, edit Save) recommended KEEP.

---

## PHASE 49 — Per-Forum Galleries — DONE
Guide: `guides/phase49-forum-galleries.md`. Photos attached to a forum post/reply display inline AND appear in a per-forum gallery (the full `GalleryClient`), gated to forum members. Schema pushed; typecheck clean; browser-verified (forum gallery shows photo, main gallery excludes it, cleanup ok). Videos remain links-only.

### [x] 49.1 — Schema: `Post.imageUrl`, `MediaItem.forumId` + `postId @unique` (cascade on post delete); db push
### [x] 49.2 — `lib/forumAccess.ts` (`canReadForum`/`canPostForum`) + `POST /api/forums/[id]/upload` (forum-access-gated Cloudinary upload, NOT the gallery toggle)
### [x] 49.3 — `POST /api/forums/[id]/posts` accepts `imageUrl` → creates forum-scoped `MediaItem` linked to the post
### [x] 49.4 — `ForumClient`: 📷 image picker on new post + reply; inline image render (links to forum gallery)
### [x] 49.5 — `GET /api/media?forumId=` (forum-access-gated) + main gallery/tag pages exclude forum media (`forumId: null`)
### [x] 49.6 — `/forum/[id]/gallery` page (access-gated) + `GalleryClient` `forumId` prop + "📷 Photo Gallery" link on forum detail
### [ ] 49.7 — (later) video file uploads; multi-image per post; tagging/hashtags on forum photos already work via reused gallery

---

## PHASE 50 — Site Admin: User Management + Forum Moderation Rework — DONE (not pushed)
### [x] 50.1 — Login tracking: `User.lastLoginAt` + `LoginEvent` model (db push); recorded in NextAuth `events.signIn`. (Existing users show "Never"/0 until next login.)
### [x] 50.2 — `/site-admin/users` list: all users, search (name/email), gym filter, sorted by gym; columns incl. last login + 30-day login count; rows link to detail. Sidebar "Users" link added.
### [x] 50.3 — `/site-admin/users/[id]`: stats (last login, 30d logins, attendance 30d, posts, commits) + full edit form (name, email, phone, belt, stripes, belt-verified, gym, roles) via `PATCH /api/site-admin/users/[id]` (email-unique + self site-admin-lockout guards) + link to public profile.
### [x] 50.4 — Site-admin gym detail: member names now link to `/site-admin/users/[id]`.
### [x] 50.5 — Forum moderation rework: `/site-admin/forums` now lists ALL forums NOT controlled by a participating gym (platform + free/non-participating gym forums, e.g. Ascend's General + 6am Crew), with gym label + post counts; select a forum → view/delete posts (`GET /api/site-admin/forums/posts?forumId=`, existing DELETE). Replaces the belt-forum-only view.
### [x] 50.6 — Belt forums retired: removed belt section from public `/forum` list; deleted belt `ForumModerationClient`. (belt.ts kept for belt badges/post-permissions; belt-posts/init APIs left orphaned/unused.)
### [x] 50.7 — Forum visibility split — DONE. "General" renamed **"DMV Jiu-Jitsu"** + made public (`gymId=null`, shown to ALL users by default). **6am Crew** kept under Ascend; forum list now renders a section headed by the **gym name** for gym-scoped forums. Public no-gym forums always default-shown. (Browser-verified.) **Reddit-style note:** when migrating public forums to a communities UX, add a `slug` field (e.g. `j/dmv`).

---

## PHASE 51 — Organization Identity ("acting as" the gym vs. yourself)
Surfaced from Phase 38 (guide §9). An owner/instructor (and possibly other authorized members) should be able to interact with forums and app features either **as their individual profile** or **on behalf of the gym/organization**. Needs its own guide before building.

### [ ] 51.1 — Posting-identity model: author attribution that can be a user OR a gym/org; decide schema (e.g. `authorGymId` on Post + render rules).
### [ ] 51.2 — Identity switcher in composers (forum post/reply, DMs?, events): choose "Post as {me}" / "Post as {Gym}".
### [ ] 51.3 — Permissions: who may post as the org (gym `admin` always; delegate to instructors?). Audit trail of which real user posted as the org.
### [ ] 51.4 — Display: org posts show the gym name + logo (links to `/gyms/[slug]`); make clear it's the organization, not a person.

---

## PHASE 52 — Class Wizard + Gym-Defined Class Programs
**Guide:** `guides/phase52-class-wizard-programs.md`. **Decisions confirmed (2026-06-06):** D1 grouping = gym-defined `ClassProgram` (custom names; the fixed `ClassGroup` enum stays for type/headers) · D2 multi-day = wizard day **checkboxes** create one `Class` per day (no `dayOfWeek` model change) · D3 access = per-user only, extended to programs (membership tiers deferred to Phase 30). Needs `prisma db push` (additive: `ClassProgram`, `Class.programId`, `Forum.programId` + `program_forum`, `User.blockedProgramIds`).

### [x] 52.1 — Schema: `ClassProgram` model, `Class.programId`, `Forum` program support (`program_forum` + `programId`), `User.blockedProgramIds`; `prisma db push` (done) + client regenerated.
### [x] 52.2 — Program CRUD: `GET/POST /api/admin/programs`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/programs/[id]` (gym-scoped, `requireAdminForProgram`); `/admin/programs` management UI.
### [x] 52.3 — Class wizard (`/admin/classes/wizard`): program select + **day-of-week checkboxes**; `POST /api/admin/classes/bulk` creates one class per day (per-day dup guard); "Create & Add Another" keeps program. Single New/Edit form + POST/PATCH also accept `programId`. Class list shows program badge + Programs/Add-Classes buttons.
### [x] 52.4 — Class-group forums (2026-06-07): `POST /api/admin/programs/[id]/forum` creates a `program_forum` (idempotent); "Create forum / View forum" on `/admin/programs`. Shown in `/forum` under the gym section (excludes blocked); access-gated in forum detail + posts/upload/media APIs + `lib/forumAccess.ts` (gym member & not in `blockedProgramIds`; site_admin bypass).
### [x] 52.5 — Per-user class-group access (2026-06-07): `ClassAccessManager` toggles the gym's class groups (`blockedProgramIds`) when the gym has any, else legacy fixed groups (demo gym); `PUT /api/admin/users/[id]/class-access` accepts both. Enforced in `/api/commitments`, `/api/checkin`, `/api/checkin/qr` (hard block) and grayed in week + day schedule views. Legacy `blockedClassGroups` kept for the demo gym. (Month-view graying not added — overview only, no register/check-in buttons.)
### [x] 52.6 — Terminology (2026-06-07): renamed UI label "Program(s)" → "Class Group(s)" across wizard, `/admin/programs` (page + client + API error msgs), class form selector, class-list "Class Groups" button. Internal `ClassProgram`/`programId` names kept. Collision resolved by user out-of-band: the fixed `ClassGroup` enum was the **demo gym (Ascend)**'s groups and has been **removed from the UI**; new gyms define their own class groups, so no relabel of the fixed enum needed.
### [x] 52.7 — Per-class editability (2026-06-07): each class is its own editable `Class` row and keeps its `programId` when edited (already wired). **Fixed the blocking bug:** duplicate-title check in `POST /api/admin/classes`, `PATCH /api/admin/classes/[id]`, and bulk now scope to **(gym, title, dayOfWeek)** — the same title is allowed on different days (was erroring "a class named X already exists" when editing Mon/Tue siblings). Also **added optional class `description`** (existing schema field) to the wizard + single form + POST/PATCH/bulk.

## SESSION LOG

**2026-06-06 — Phase 38 owner onboarding, multi-tenancy hardening, Phase 52 core**
- **Phase 38 DONE** (autonomous run): intent branch, owner-context admin+instructor grant (`asOwner`), `/onboarding/owner` wizard, member preview, dup detection (`/api/gyms/similar`), `Gym.setupProgress` + `/admin` setup card. Gym-admin **logo URL** editing added (`/admin/settings` + `PATCH /api/admin/gym`). `prisma db push` for `setupProgress` was blocked mid-session by the CRDB monthly RU cap, then succeeded once the cluster came back.
- **Default admin dashboard:** logo + login send admins to `/admin` (new `/start` redirect for Google OAuth); "My Dashboard" tile on `/admin` → `/dashboard`. `useSession().update()` after owner grant so middleware admits new roles without re-login.
- **Multi-tenancy hardening:** gym-scoped every admin view/API to `session.user.gymId` (site_admin bypass). New guards `requireAdminForUser` / `requireAdminForClass` / `requireAdminForProgram`. Closed cross-gym IDOR on user roles/belt/class-access/promote/**email+password-reset**, classes edit, store orders, etc. Fixed `getGymSettings()` `findFirst()` cross-tenant bug → keyed on unique `gymId`. `/admin` stat "Total Students" → **"Total Members"**. Rule captured in memory [[project_tenancy_model]].
- **Phase 52 core (52.1–52.3) DONE:** gym-defined `ClassProgram` (+ `Class.programId`, `Forum.programId`/`program_forum`, `User.blockedProgramIds` — all pushed); `/admin/programs` CRUD; class **wizard** `/admin/classes/wizard` with day-of-week checkboxes (`/api/admin/classes/bulk`, one class/day) + "Create & Add Another"; single form + classes POST/PATCH accept `programId`; program badge on class list.
- **NEXT SESSION:** Phase **52.4** (program forums) + **52.5** (per-user program access) — schema already in place. See `guides/phase52-class-wizard-programs.md` §4–§5.
- All work typecheck + `npm run build` clean (136 pages). NOT browser-tested (no dev server up). **NOT committed/pushed** — user handles git.

**2026-06-05 (cont. 6) — Forum visibility: public "DMV Jiu-Jitsu" + 6am Crew under Ascend**
- Renamed "General" → **DMV Jiu-Jitsu**, set `gymId=null` (platform-wide public, default-shown to all). **6am Crew** stays under Ascend; forum list groups gym-scoped forums under a gym-name section. (Phase 50.7 done.) Data change is live on the shared cluster; UI grouping code NOT pushed yet (until pushed, prod shows both in "General").

**2026-06-05 (cont. 5) — Phase 50 site-admin user management + forum moderation rework**
- Built login tracking (`lastLoginAt` + `LoginEvent`, recorded on sign-in) → powers admin stats.
- New **Users** tab: list (search + gym filter + last-login + 30d logins) → user detail with stats + full edit (incl. roles/gym) via site-admin API. Gym-detail member names now clickable.
- Reworked **Forums** tab into moderation of all non-participating-gym forums (view/delete posts); **retired belt forums** (removed from public forum list + deleted belt moderation client).
- Confirmed General + 6am Crew forums already gymId=Ascend Jiu Jitsu (shown with gym label in moderation list).
- Schema pushed; typecheck + production build clean. **NOT committed/pushed** (user handles pushes).

**2026-06-03/05 (cont. 4) — Weight class removal, gallery restore, beta notice, Phase 49 forum galleries**
- **Profile weight class removed** from bio (edit form + own + public profile). Tournament/competition weight classes untouched. `User.weightClass` column kept.
- **Gallery demo pics restored** — re-ran `prisma/seed-gallery.ts` (12 Pexels photos, assigned to Admin User). Uploads already off platform-wide (`galleryUploadEnabled=false`) so gallery is **view-only** for non-admins; admins still upload.
- **Beta notice** (`app/components/BetaNotice.tsx`): site-wide **footer** banner + **help-page** box — "AscendIt is in active testing," lists available features, links **"Message AscendIt Admin"** → DM with the **`admin@ascendit.app`** account (the site_admin named "AscendIt Admin", id `cmpx7uwqu000004lgehyt7lrd`). Renamed `admin@gym.com` back to "Admin User" to avoid duplicate names. (Real mailbox for admin@ascendit.app to be created later via Resend.)
- **Phase 49 — per-forum galleries** built + verified (see above).
- **Test student** `student1@gym.com` / `student1234` recreated (un-onboarded) via `scripts/add-test-student.ts` for manual onboarding testing; idempotent reset.
- **Prod deploy confirmed working** by user earlier. **NOTE: not yet committed/pushed at time of this entry** — user was about to `commit and push all changes`.

**2026-06-02 (cont. 3) — Soft-release cleanup, forum edit/like, QR gating, navbar toggles, 'ScendIt, beta prep + PUSHED**
- **Data purge (soft release)** — ran `scripts/soft-release-cleanup.ts` against the live CockroachDB cluster. Result: **4 users** (admin@gym.com [admin/site_admin], instructor1@gym.com [Marcus Silva], geof.hoffman.ascend@gmail.com, geof.hoffman@gmail.com [site_admin, gymless]); **1 gym "Ascend Jiu Jitsu"** (slug `ascend`, **non-participating/free**); **2 forums** General + 6am Crew (members subscribed); 0 posts; all test classes/sessions/tournaments/media/messages purged. Deleted instructor2 + 26 others + 4 junk gyms.
- **Forum edit + 👍 like** — new `PostLike` model (db push); `POST/DELETE /api/posts/[id]/like`; content-edit added to `PATCH /api/posts/[id]` (author/admin); ForumClient: like button + count + inline edit on posts & replies; delete already existed. Typecheck clean; partial browser check (login/nav/post-form confirmed; full like/edit click-through interrupted).
- **QR gating** — `/profile` QR shown only to participating-gym members (auto-appears when gym turns participating / user joins one). [[47.7]] gym-onboarding note → 46.5.
- **Navbar visibility toggles** — added platform flags `feedEnabled/scheduleEnabled/forumsEnabled/eventsEnabled` (db push) + site-admin Settings toggles; Header (desktop+mobile) + dashboard tiles gate on them; admins bypass (getEffectiveFeatures ALL_ON).
- **'ScendIt rename** — Group A + journal save (see Phase 48). Group B/C pending decision.
- **Hid dev delete-account button** in production.
- **Emergency contact removed** from default onboarding; `User.emergencyContact` kept → Phase 46 (gym-requestable).
- **Built earlier this session:** Phase 44 (messaging poll, push centralized into `createNotification`, cron deleted, forum cleanup + unread badges, dashboard zones, onboarding menu cue, PWA icons), Phase 45 (one-way follow + feed + notifications), BUG-8 (gallery visible-vs-upload split). Added Phases 38–43 (product backlog) + 46/47/48.
- **PUSHED to origin/main by user (2026-06-02)** — production build verified (`BUILD_ID` ok) before push; Vercel should deploy. devDeps: `playwright` + Chromium added for browser verification (`scripts/verify-*.mjs`).

**2026-06-02 (cont.) — BUG-8: split gallery toggle (visibility vs upload) + remove emergency contact**
- **BUG-8 fixed:** gallery had ONE effective flag that hid the feature AND blocked uploads, so a gym admin's "Gallery" toggle made the whole feature vanish. Split into two concepts at both scopes: `gallery` (visible/browsable) = `platform.galleryEnabled && gym.galleryEnabled`; `galleryUpload` = that AND `platform.galleryUploadEnabled && gym.galleryUploadEnabled`. Added `PlatformSettings.galleryEnabled` + `GymFeatures.galleryUploadEnabled` (db push). Upload button + `POST /api/media` now gate on `galleryUpload`; nav/page still gate on `gallery`. New toggles in both site-admin + gym-admin settings UIs. **Verified** (`scripts/verify-gallery.mjs`): uploads-off→browsable+no-upload+POST 403; visible-off→redirect+nav hidden. Test flags restored to original after.
- **Emergency contact removed from default onboarding** (user: "I don't think we need to ask for an emergency contact"). `User.emergencyContact` column kept. Added **Phase 46 — Gym Custom Student Onboarding** (participating/paid gyms customize new-student onboarding + opt into requesting emergency contact).

**2026-06-02 (cont.) — Phase 45: user follow + activity feed**
- Built one-way follow (no user-to-user model existed before — only DMs). `Follow` model + `new_follower`/`followed_post` notif types (db push); `lib/feed.ts` PUBLIC_FORUM_TYPES; follow API; `FollowButton`; public-profile gym affiliation + follower/following counts + post history (+ "show all activity I can see" toggle); `/feed` page + nav link; follower-post notifications (public forums only, deduped vs subscribers).
- **Browser-verified** (Playwright, `scripts/verify-follow.mjs`): follow 0→1 + persists across reload, profile/feed render. Had to **restart the dev server** — it held a stale Prisma client from before the schema push (`prisma.follow` 500'd until restart). Dev server now running fresh on :3002 (bg).
- **45.8 (phone/email show-on-profile toggles) deferred** — awaiting confirmation on whether email should ever show.

**2026-06-02 — Phase 44: messaging poll, push centralization, cron removal, forum/dashboard/onboarding UX, PWA icons**
- **Messaging (44.1)** — `MessageThread` now polls every 5s; incoming messages appear without refresh + auto mark-read.
- **Push (44.2)** — diagnosed: built but `createNotification` never called `sendPush`, so DMs/most events never pushed. Centralized push into `createNotification`; removed 5 redundant calls. VAPID vars confirmed in Vercel Prod+Preview.
- **Cron (44.3)** — confirmed zero scheduled crons (`vercel.json` `{}`); deleted dormant `app/api/cron/*` + removed `CRON_SECRET` (`.env.local` + Vercel Prod). Inline notifications replaced cron.
- **Forums (44.4/44.5)** — "Forum"→"Forums" nav; new `ForumRead` model (db push done) for unread badges; default list hides unsubscribed (gym/own-belt/announcements always shown) + "Show all available forums" toggle; unread-first sorting.
- **Dashboard (44.6)** — grouped icon-tile zones (This Week/Community/You/Manage), attendance demoted + conditional, Messages unread tile, gym-aware empty state.
- **Onboarding (44.7)** — step-6 animated `☰` menu cue + gym-aware CTA (Schedule vs Events).
- **PWA icons (44.8)** — regenerated all icons from `logo.png` via `scripts/generate-pwa-icons.mjs` (was stale blue-"A").
- **Added Phases 38–43** (registration split, gym claiming, invitations/CSV, class grouping, private-lesson availability, legal/waivers) from user product notes — all OPEN.
- **Verification** — installed `playwright` (devDep) + Chromium; `scripts/verify-ui.mjs` drove login + dashboard/forum (desktop+mobile) + onboarding (throwaway user, deleted after). All checks ✓.
- **Nothing committed/pushed** (standing rule). Dev server on :3002; `.next` was cleared (restart needed).

**2026-06-01 — Phase 35/36 UX, Phase 37 gym toggles, Phase 30 payments plan, Resend key, copy**
- **36.1** — fixed onboarding gym return-from-register (no step-1 restart / re-prompt; "you're now a member" banner). Finding: `POST /api/gyms` already auto-joins creator.
- **Phase 35/36** — wrote `guides/phase35-ux-audit.md`, triaged into Phase 36. Executed 36.3 (drop avatar URL), 36.4 (standardize "Skip for now"), 36.5 (admin-tour CTAs → `/gyms/register`), 36.6 (empty states OK + dashboard now hides Journal/Lessons when feature off), 36.8 (admin user-detail grouped), 36.9 (sub-step label), 36.10 (nav pattern documented). **36.7 parked** (needs your call — trims signup reflection data).
- **Phase 37** — per-gym feature toggles: new `GymFeatures` model (+ client-safe `lib/gymFeatureFlags.ts`), `lib/features.ts` `getEffectiveFeatures` (platform AND gym, admin bypass), nav + page hiding, API enforcement on 6 routes, `/admin/settings` "Gym Features" UI, `prisma db push` done, `scripts/setup-ascend-gym.ts` created the **Ascend** demo gym + moved 3 instructors. Confirmed Phase 33 toggles were API-only; added UI hiding. Verified via `scripts/verify-gym-features.ts` (10/10). **Found: platform flags `storeEnabled`, `galleryUploadEnabled`, `allowEventSubmission`, `allowBeltForumPosting` are currently OFF in DB → now also hidden in UI for non-admins.**
- **Phase 30 (payments)** — wrote `guides/phase30-payment-system.md` (Stripe Connect/Billing framework + spec-vs-schema reconciliation); rewrote Phase 30 into 13 tasks (30A–30E). **All 17 design decisions captured (guide §21)**, incl. social-network-first tier model (see memory). Build still gated on Stripe test-credential setup (30.0a–g) + go-ahead. Saved `[[project_tier_model]]` memory.
- **Resend key** — rotated `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env.local` + pushed to Vercel Production + Preview (upgraded Vercel CLI 53→54.6.1 to get past an agent-mode bug). `EMAIL_FROM` still not pushed; old key not revoked.
- **heroBanner** — diagnosed "old banner persists" as a stale `w=384` next/image variant cached in the dev server (not the file); fix = kill server + `rm -rf .next` + restart + hard refresh. Saved gotcha to memory.
- **Landing copy** — hero subtitle changed to "Message with your team, journal your goals & progress, share photos, find open mats and more…" (individual-first; was gym-gated verbs). Note: headline still has "jui jitsu" typo (unfixed, pending your OK).
- **Nothing committed/pushed** (per standing rule). Dev server left running on :3002.

**2026-05-30/31 — Platform settings completion, 32.8, auth UX, bug fixes, housekeeping**
- Finished the interrupted **Phase 33** platform feature-toggles work: wired enforcement for the 3 unenforced flags (`allowBeltForumPosting`, `galleryUploadEnabled`, `storeEnabled`); verified `PlatformSettings` table exists in DB and client is generated; typecheck clean. Committed as `0385fe6` (not pushed).
- **32.8** — surfaced public tournaments on `/events` (purple "Tournament" chip + filter, links to results); `/tournaments/` made public-readable in middleware. (uncommitted)
- **Phase 34** — self-service forgot-password (`/forgot-password` + API), reusable `PasswordInput` eye toggle on login/register/reset, and `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking` on Google. (uncommitted)
- **BUG-6** — fixed dev hydration mismatch caused by the service worker serving stale `/_next/static/` bundles; SW now only registers in production and self-cleans in dev. (uncommitted)
- **BUG-7** — fixed bracket winner-dropdown not saving the first option (controlled-select value with no matching option). (uncommitted)
- Added `todo.html` (browser checklist) + sync instructions; added Stripe **test-mode** credential subtasks (30.0a–g) + **Phase 35** UX-audit guide task to both TODO files.
- **Untracked the 19 guides** via `git rm -r --cached guides/` (staged deletions; files remain on disk); `/guides/` + `/todo.html` in `.gitignore`.
- Created **15 test competitors** (`testcomp1–15@ascend.test`, pw `Test1234!`) + active memberships, registered 5 to each of the 3 divisions of "in-house, whitebelt toruney" via `scripts/seed-tournament-test.ts` (idempotent, untracked).
- **Clarified Phase 28/32 status:** both fully built + nav-wired, but invisible locally due to BUG-6's stale SW bundle, and absent from production because local `main` is **3 commits ahead of origin** (nothing pushed).

### Pending decisions / next session
1. **Beta blockers (Phase 47):** email domain + `EMAIL_FROM` to Vercel (47.1) is the top one; then legal pages (47.2), rate limiting (47.3), error monitoring (47.4), crew signup link + welcome post (47.5/47.6).
2. **Forum media (47.8) — DECISION:** videos links-only vs file upload? Then build `Post.imageUrl` + composer image picker (Cloudinary ready).
3. **'ScendIt Group B (48.2) — DECISION:** rename the remaining form submits, or stop at Group A + journal?
4. **Verify forum like/edit in browser** — built + typechecked but full click-through was interrupted (`scripts/verify-softrelease.mjs` exists; it failed only on a selector, not the feature). After a `prisma db push` the dev server MUST be restarted (stale client → `prisma.X` 500s) — recurring gotcha this session.
5. **Phase 30 payment terms** still undecided — blocks all of Phase 30 (Stripe TEST MODE when unblocked).
6. **Optional:** gate `DELETE /api/account` to non-production too (button already hidden in prod).
7. **Deploy state:** all work pushed to `origin/main` 2026-06-02; confirm the Vercel prod deploy succeeded + smoke-test prod (login, forums, profile).
